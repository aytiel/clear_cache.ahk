# clear_cache.ahk
A quick complementary script to SexualRhinoceros's Discord music bot found here: https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot

The bot does not account for the hard drive space taken up by the song cache (~1 GB per hr). 
This script alleviates that issue by simply emptying the folder containing the song cache every 30 minutes.

Written in the AutoHotKey scripting language.
